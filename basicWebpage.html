            <h2>Bulawayo</h2>
            <p>It's high time we as Africans invested in our own continet, touring could be one of many ways of
                doing
                that.
                We could get to go around, invest in our own continent, know it and know our brothers and sisters as
                well
                and their different types of culture as well. Africa is such an amazing and unique Continent, and
                Bulawayo City
                which has the great Victoria Falls, the biggest waterfall in the world. it is in between Zimbabwe
                and
                Zambia,
                it makes this roaring sound when water hits the ground,the people call it the smoke that thunders,
                it's
                such an amazing
                place to be at. Bulawayo has many touring sides one could visit. I like the fact that Ndebele people
                recided in
                that side of Zimbabwe, I as a South African I would relate a lot with them mainly because of culture
                and
                where they originally come from before they migrated to Zimbabwe and places they have been before
                settling down
                in that side of the Country they got such a rich history, it's beautiful
